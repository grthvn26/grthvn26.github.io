                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Aaron, here are some of my personal and professional skills! I am a fast-learner, dependent, and I have great social skills.<sup>1</sup>
                         For my soft skills, I have a handful of personal and social skills.<sup>2</sup> 
                         For my personal skills, I know how to collaborate with other people with ease.<sup>3</sup> 
                         I also have great problem solving skills, and the best of them all I have good communcation depending on the person I'm talking to.<sup>4</sup> I also do have great time management skills, good for crunching projects in a short time.<sup>5</sup> Nonetheless, for my technical skills, I know C++, C, Java, R, and Python Programming languages.<sup>6</sup> I have little knowledge about HTML and CSS.<sup>7</sup> I haven't fully mastered all of them but I know the basic information about it.<sup>8</sup> I also want to sideline game development using the Monogame Framework based on the discontinued XNA Framework of Microsoft.<sup>9</sup> For database skills, I only know MongoDB and MySQL Server, nothing much but it'll take time before I learn a new database system.<sup>10</sup> Another fun fact is, I was supposed to participate in the hardware assembly and disassembly competition in UMAK I.T. Olympics.<sup>11</sup> Unfortunately, that is the only event that did not take place.<sup>12</sup>Another skill that I have is I know photography and videography alike, although I don't know how to edit videos effectively, I know how to edit photos in my spare time.<sup>13</sup> Another hard skill that I have is basic computer troubleshooting and networking.<sup>14</sup> I excel in repairing damaged parts both in software and hardware applications.<sup>15</sup>I also know how to mix and master audio files, since that's one of my hobbies to do.<sup>16</sup>I usually learn most of my skills, but some are just there with me ever since.<sup>17</sup> Skills isn't the only thing that keeps me working, determination and willingness are also my allies.<sup>18</sup> With these skills in mind, I know how to adapt in different fields, and also learning them along the way.<sup>19</sup>Skills are just a set of things that you can do and must master in the future.<sup>20</sup> For now, I'm still inside a learning bubble.<sup>21</sup>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>
                        Aside from being an College Student, I also love to play video games, instruments, and a handful of sports.<sup>1</sup> From my childhood, I used to play a lot of console games, namely the Playstation and the Xbox Series.<sup>2</sup> I also got to enjoy handheld consoles such as the Playstation Portable and Gameboy Advance.<sup>3</sup> I love to play FPS games and since Counter Strike is my childhood favorite, I used to play semi-pro Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.<sup>4</sup> I enjoyed playing RPG games and other genres.<sup>5</sup> Aside from games, I also play instruments and listening to music.<sup>6</sup> Well, I only picked up instruments way back when I was in highschool, but that roots back to my childhood when I discovered rock music.<sup>7</sup> I know how to play bass, guitar, keyboards, drums, and the occassional vocals.<sup>8</sup> Also, I am the current Vice President of the University of the East - Jam Sessions Manila, so that makes my name.<sup>9</sup> I love to perform and attend concerts.<sup>10</sup> Aside from instruments and games, I know a handful of sports.<sup>11</sup> Sports such as basketball, badminton, and volleyball though I am not proficient in these types of activities, I still enjoy to play them.<sup>12</sup> One of my favorite sports is billiards, I have my own cue stick and love to play the sport for hours, even though its a pain in my wallet.<sup>13</sup> My other hobbies are tinkering with tech, most particularly building computers.<sup>14</sup> I also love to make arduino projects and android software.<sup>15</sup>Sometimes I read books and learn programming and other technology related things.<sup>16</sup> Well and the occassional exercise and gym.<sup>17</sup> I used to lift weights and know how to do construction in our house, I know basic plumbing and electrical wirings.<sup>18</sup> With that said, hobbies are just another interesting part of my life, without them I wouldn't be the person I am today.<sup>19</sup>As my father said, "Hobbies are just one interesting tale of your life, never forget about your goals and studies."<sup>20</sup>

                    <h3>Interests</h3>
                    <p>
                       Some of my interests can be rooted from back to my childhood.<sup>1</sup> Ever since I'm young, I always tinker with tech.<sup>2</sup> From old consoles to new computers, there is something my mind would tell me to play with.<sup>3</sup> Most of my interests are well-centered with technology, but I also have other interests that keeps my mind alive.<sup>4</sup> I have an interest in creating and producing music, although I haven't tried to create music, I usually watch videos online on how to produce them.<sup>5</sup> Another interest I have in mind is writing one-shots, another underground interest that I have.<sup>6</sup>I also have an interest in the science of space, I usually watch videos online about space technology and how they work.<sup>7</sup> Another is Law, I sometimes read law books and learn how the law works in our country.<sup>8</sup> A sidenote is I've always wanted to be a lawyer before, but due to my expertise in computers, I've instead taken a degree in Information Technology.<sup>9</sup> Innovation is by far my favorite interest of them all, learning how new technology works and how they are created always mean much to me as someone who is hooked to technology.<sup>10</sup> I also love watching medical dramas and other similar shows, I once read a medical handbook published by Oxford.<sup>11</sup> Since every interest that I have always contributes to my general knowledge, I learned how to use them from time to time to train my memory.<sup>12</sup> I also love playing memory games that gives me the juice to get me going on with my day.<sup>13</sup> Another interest is DJing, or just mixing party music.<sup>14</sup>I also seem to have a liking in using sound systems, with the goal of creating a sound-quality speaker setup in our house.<sup>15</sup> I also love cars specifically the Japan Domestic Market or most commonly known as JDM, I usually buy small figurines from Tomica and display them in my desk.<sup>16</sup> Since I spoke about figurines, I also built gundams before, but I sold them afterwards.<sup>17</sup> I did cycling before but that all died down slowly after.<sup>18</sup>Will all of my interests laid down, I only have one question in my life, "Why do I like these?", It's a bit weird per se, but I frequently ask that question a lot.<sup>19</sup> Interests are just one bit of my whole life, I will always cherish them forever.<sup>20</sup>
