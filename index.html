        <h3>Childhood Years</h3>
    </div> 

    <div align="justify">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl's life began in Marikina City, Philippines, on July 26, 2005. <sup>1</sup> Seven years later, 
            his sister arrived in the family. <sup>2</sup>His early years were spent with his parents until his 
            father went abroad to provide for them. <sup>3</sup>This was hard for Carl, but he understood his 
            father's sacrifice.<sup>4</sup> His relationship with his paternal grandparents is bittersweet, and 
            living with them presented challenges, particularly with the tension between his mother 
            and grandmother.<sup>5</sup> Despite this, Carl's parents worked hard to make ends meet.<sup>6</sup> His 
            mother focused on raising their children while his father worked overseas.<sup>7</sup> Before 
            elementary school, he attended a small preparatory school where he excelled rapidly 
            academically. <sup>8</sup>He didn’t like the environment in his class before; not long after he 
            graduated preparatory grade, Carl attended a Christian elementary school, where his 
            extroverted personality was well-known by his peers. <sup>9</sup>He was a spirited child with a 
            strong faith in God; academics came easy for him, and he consistently earned excellent 
            academic performance. <sup>10</sup>However, this changed with this last and sixth academic year, 
            when his grades began declining. <sup>11</sup>His final year of elementary school was bittersweet, 
            making it more complicated with his difficult classmates.<sup>12</sup> With that, he enjoyed sports 
            and music before, alongside video games. <sup>13</sup>He’d rather play for hours than study for a 
            test or quiz. <sup>14</sup>He also enjoyed playing with his friends, riding bikes, and doing other 
            activities without causing too much stress.<sup>15</sup> He’d sometimes blast their home speakers in 
            full volume with his favorite music disks playing. <sup>16</sup>His academic decline was 
            disappointing; however, Carl maintained determination and optimism about his future. <sup>17</sup>
            He dreamed of becoming a chef, a doctor, or an engineer, although his path remained 
            unclear. <sup>18</sup>His teenage years brought about significant changes in his life. <sup>19</sup>His younger 
            years were a period of self-growth filled with new experiences and lessons. <sup>20</sup><blockquote></blockquote></p>

        <h3>Teenage Years</h3>
    </div> 
        
  
    <div align="justify">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl attended APEC Schools Marikina Heights for high school in his teenage years 
            from 2017 to 2023.<sup>1</sup> Coming from a small elementary class, he experienced a significant 
            culture shock back in seventh grade;<sup>2</sup> suddenly surrounded by many students, he quickly 
            adjusted to the environment and started to make early friends later on.<sup>3</sup>He enjoyed the 
            people at APEC and made friends with his teachers. <sup>4</sup>He made great friends in his first 
            year of high school but also lost others.<sup>5</sup> His first two years were an academic struggle, 
            and he did not find his momentum.<sup>6</sup>But something clicked from ninth grade onward; he 
            excelled academically, demonstrating his true academic potential.<sup>7</sup>APEC became a place 
            where he met new people and made exciting memories; some of his friends remain 
            strong until today. <sup>8</sup>His passion for music ignited in ninth grade when he picked up a 
            bass guitar that he still plays enthusiastically.<sup>9</sup>He also enjoyed videography, 
            photography, and editing, which made him even more familiar with technology. <sup>10</sup>Coding 
            was his favorite pastime, and it made it clear what future would be ahead of him.<sup>11</sup>
            Cycling became one of his favorite hobbies during his last senior year, a passion that 
            sadly faded after a heartbreak.<sup>12</sup> He made his mark during their fun week in his final year, 
            performing guitar at an event and earning fame.<sup>13</sup>Not everything in his high school was a 
            happy memory; there were also sad memories.<sup>14</sup>Aside from being a significant figure in 
            APEC, he was known for his friendly actions and was always approachable and kind to 
            those around him.<sup>15</sup> His leadership skills were tested when he led his research group, 
            winning an award for their prototype.<sup>16</sup> Another significant event was his judging a 
            science day in APEC, which he was proud of due to his project being highlighted by 
            other groups. He discovered his strengths and passions in his high school years.<sup>17</sup> The 
            transition from a small elementary school made his life change.<sup>18</sup> He learned to adapt to 
            different environments: resilience, growth, and optimism.<sup>19</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the present years, Carl has attended the University of the East, pursuing a 
            Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.<sup>1</sup> Ignited by his passion for computers, he 
            is eager to learn more about programming, web development, and others.<sup>2</sup> He is 
            currently a second-year student with more spare time to deepen his knowledge.<sup>3</sup> Carl 
            wasn’t sure about information technology initially, as he wanted to pursue a career in 
            law or medicine.<sup>4</sup> That said, he only chose the degree due to his initial knowledge of 
            technology.<sup>5</sup> He was not initially interested in attending the University of the East, but his 
            friend suggested doing so.<sup>6</sup> His first year was filled with excitement and eagerness, and 
            he kept working on new activities and other academics while working on his self-image.<sup>7</sup>
            He quickly made new friends with his extroverted personality, but he is puzzled by his 
            new groups to join with.<sup>8</sup>He vowed to create memories and experiences.<sup>9</sup> Being in the 
            university, Carl slowly regained his potential for his passion for music, and he is 
            currently the Vice President of the University of the East - Jam Sessions Manila.<sup>10</sup> Aside 
            from being a student, he also loves being involved in student organizations, but that is 
            soon fading away for personal reasons.<sup>11</sup> He is also skilled in other programming-related 
            projects like Arduino and Android SDKs.<sup>12</sup> He does not excel well in web development and 
            back-end development.<sup>13</sup> During his second year, he is experimenting with different 
            projects, such as game development via the Monogame framework based on the 
            obsolete XNA framework.<sup>14</sup>With these academics in mind, Carl is a hard-working student 
            who is always willing to learn.<sup>15</sup> More experiences are yet to cross his headings as he 
            embarks on a journey for success.<sup>16</sup> However, Carl's journey is still something that he has to
            work and hold onto.<sup>17</sup> He never gives up with the harshest moments of his life and always keeps on going even though
            everything is falling apart.<sup>18</sup> He just has one motto in life. "All things come to an end". <sup>19</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>
