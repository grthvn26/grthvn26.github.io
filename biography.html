                    <h3>Childhood Years</h3>
                    <p>
                        Carl's life began in Marikina City, Philippines, on July 26, 2005. Seven years later, 
                        his sister arrived in the family. His early years were spent with his parents until his 
                        father went abroad to provide for them. This was hard for Carl, but he understood his 
                        father's sacrifice. His relationship with his paternal grandparents is bittersweet, and 
                        living with them presented challenges, particularly with the tension between his mother 
                        and grandmother. Despite this, Carl's parents worked hard to make ends meet. His 
                        mother focused on raising their children while his father worked overseas. Before 
                        elementary school, he attended a small preparatory school where he excelled rapidly 
                        academically. He didn’t like the environment in his class before; not long after he 
                        graduated preparatory grade, Carl attended a Christian elementary school, where his 
                        extroverted personality was well-known by his peers. He was a spirited child with a 
                        strong faith in God; academics came easy for him, and he consistently earned excellent 
                        academic performance. However, this changed with this last and sixth academic year, 
                        when his grades began declining. His final year of elementary school was bittersweet, 
                        making it more complicated with his difficult classmates. With that, he enjoyed sports 
                        and music before, alongside video games. He’d rather play for hours than study for a 
                        test or quiz. He also enjoyed playing with his friends, riding bikes, and doing other 
                        activities without causing too much stress. He’d sometimes blast their home speakers in 
                        full volume with his favorite music disks playing. His academic decline was 
                        disappointing; however, Carl maintained determination and optimism about his future. 
                        He dreamed of becoming a chef, a doctor, or an engineer, although his path remained 
                        unclear. His teenage years brought about significant changes in his life. His younger 
                        years were a period of self-growth filled with new experiences and lessons.

                    <h3>Teenage Years</h3>
                    <p>
                        Carl attended APEC Schools Marikina Heights for high school in his teenage years 
                        from 2017 to 2023. Coming from a small elementary class, he experienced a significant 
                        culture shock back in seventh grade; suddenly surrounded by many students, he quickly 
                        adjusted to the environment and started to make early friends later on. He enjoyed the 
                        people at APEC and made friends with his teachers. He made great friends in his first 
                        year of high school but also lost others. His first two years were an academic struggle, 
                        and he did not find his momentum. But something clicked from ninth grade onward; he 
                        excelled academically, demonstrating his true academic potential. APEC became a place 
                        where he met new people and made exciting memories; some of his friends remain 
                        strong until today. His passion for music ignited in ninth grade when he picked up a 
                        bass guitar that he still plays enthusiastically. He also enjoyed videography, 
                        photography, and editing, which made him even more familiar with technology. Coding 
                        was his favorite pastime, and it made it clear what future would be ahead of him.
                        Cycling became one of his favorite hobbies during his last senior year, a passion that 
                        sadly faded after a heartbreak. He made his mark during their fun week in his final year, 
                        performing guitar at an event and earning fame. Not everything in his high school was a 
                        happy memory; there were also sad memories. Aside from being a significant figure in 
                        APEC, he was known for his friendly actions and was always approachable and kind to 
                        those around him. His leadership skills were tested when he led his research group, 
                        winning an award for their prototype. Another significant event was his judging a 
                        science day in APEC, which he was proud of due to his project being highlighted by 
                        other groups. He discovered his strengths and passions in his high school years. The 
                        transition from a small elementary school made his life change. He learned to adapt to 
                        different environments: resilience, growth, and optimism.

                    <h3>College Years</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the present years, Carl has attended the University of the East, pursuing a 
                        Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Ignited by his passion for computers, he 
                        is eager to learn more about programming, web development, and others. He is 
                        currently a second-year student with more spare time to deepen his knowledge. Carl 
                        wasn’t sure about information technology initially, as he wanted to pursue a career in 
                        law or medicine. That said, he only chose the degree due to his initial knowledge of 
                        technology. He was not initially interested in attending the University of the East, but his 
                        friend suggested doing so. His first year was filled with excitement and eagerness, and 
                        he kept working on new activities and other academics while working on his self-image.
                        He quickly made new friends with his extroverted personality, but he is puzzled by his 
                        new groups to join with. He vowed to create memories and experiences. Being in the 
                        university, Carl slowly regained his potential for his passion for music, and he is 
                        currently the Vice President of the University of the East - Jam Sessions Manila. Aside 
                        from being a student, he also loves being involved in student organizations, but that is 
                        soon fading away for personal reasons. He is also skilled in other programming-related 
                        projects like Arduino and Android SDKs. He does not excel well in web development and 
                        back-end development. During his second year, he is experimenting with different 
                        projects, such as game development via the Monogame framework based on the 
                        obsolete XNA framework. With these academics in mind, Carl is a hard-working student 
                        who is always willing to learn. More experiences are yet to cross his headings as he 
                        embarks on a journey for success. However, Carl's journey is still something that he has to
                        work and hold onto. He never gives up with the harshest moments of his life and always keeps on going even though
                        everything is falling apart. He just has one motto in life. "All things come to an end".
