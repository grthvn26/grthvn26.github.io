            <h2>Why Seoul is Special To Me?</h2>
            <p>Seoul is a vibrant city that blends modern skyscrapers with traditional palaces and temples.
                 It's known for its rich culture, delicious food, and bustling shopping districts. Seoul was named the World Design Capital in 2010 and has served as the national hub for the music, entertainment, and cultural industries that have propelled K-pop and the Korean Wave to international prominence.
                Since I love K-dramas and Korean Pop, Seoul would be one of my go to places to be in.</p>
